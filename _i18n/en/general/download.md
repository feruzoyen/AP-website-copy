AntennaPod is only officially published in above two stores because we don't have the time to support more. All other stores listing AntennaPod copied the app without our explicit permission. We are not responsible for updating those or making sure they work correctly. The F-Droid repository is not maintained by us, but by the people behind F-Droid. If it is not the latest version, there's not so much we can do but you can always let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/), and we'll investigate it.
