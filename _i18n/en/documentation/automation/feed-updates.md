If you disable global refresh for a feed then if you refresh the feed list from the queue, from the episodes list or from a scheduled update then that feed will not be refreshed. Further, any new episodes for the feed will not show up in `Episodes` Â» `New` though they will continue to show up under the Feed's episode view.
