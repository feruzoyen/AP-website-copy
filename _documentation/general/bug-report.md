# I found a bug!
That is sad to hear. Please let us know by creating a post on our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/). Please make sure to use the search function first, so the same bug is not reported multiple times. Please include the system information that is displayed in `Settings` Â» `Report bug`.

# You made a spelling mistake

While changing it yourself is the fastest method, you can also just write a post in the translators section of our [forum](https://forum.antennapod.org/).
